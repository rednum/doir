# Discrete Optimization in Rust

This repository contains some optimization problems and their solutions in Rust programming language. This is loosely based on a course given on University of Warsaw (see  https://bitbucket.org/marcinmucha/odwp) and is still a work in progress. The point of those problems is teaching some general optimization methods (for example simulated annealing), rather than guessing some clever specific algorithms.

## What's there

The `src/problems` contains problem statements and some verification code as well. The `src/solutions` contains my solutions.
